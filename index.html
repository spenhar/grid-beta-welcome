              The Grid is a big idea. And by now, a lot of people see that. But you saw it first.
              Of the more than forty thousand people who have signed on to become founding members, you saw the genius of the Grid before anyone else. You looked past impracticalities, impossibilities, and frankly, endless chances to fail. You stepped up and decided to make our vision your own. 
              That’s why we like you. That’s why we need you. That’s why you’re reading this. 
            </p>

              This is a beta. We want you to take it, break it, get mad at it, and tell us why. Tell us where it falls short, flies high, what it lacks and where it leads you. You’re the ones that saw this for what it could be, and you’re the ones that will help make our vision a reality. Because like us, you see the future not for what it seems it will be, but for what you imagine it could be. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You’re now on board Spaceship Earth. So, where should we fly this thing?
